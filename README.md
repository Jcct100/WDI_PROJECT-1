## GA WDI-30 Project 1: 'Design a Game'

### Introduction: 

For my first project at General Assembly. I built a 2D game using HTML, CSS and Jquery. 

### Concept:

In this project Iâ€™ve made a fun and interactive game which aims to engage and educate young people about ivory trade (campaign: https://www.wwf.org.uk/stoptheivorytrade ) 

![alt](https://i.imgur.com/zucx5Ng.png)	 The player takes the role of a young elephant and tries to unite the herds to safety by overcoming challenges along the way.

 In this game, you have 60 seconds to lead the herds to safety. There will be fire coming at you which you will have to jump over them and if you get hit more than three times the game will be over. ![alt](https://i.imgur.com/GIEHFtU.png)	   Every three times the elephant  manage to jump over the  fire. There is a pop up message educating the player about the importance of the international ivory trade to wild elephant survival.
