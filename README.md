# WDI_PROJECT-1
In this project Iâ€™ve made a fun and interactive game which aims to engage and educate young people about ivory trade (campaign: https://www.wwf.org.uk/stoptheivorytrade ) The player takes the role of a young elephant and tries to unite the herds to lead them to safety by overcoming challenges along the way.  In this game, you will have 60 seconds to lead the herds to safety.  There will be fire coming at you which if you get hit three times the game will be over.   Every three times the elephant  manage to jump over the  fire successfully. There is a pop up message educating the player about the importance of the international ivory trade to wild elephant survival.  Also after 30 seconds the fire gets bigger making the game more challenging.  Some of the coding challenges I have to overcome were [show the codes1)2)3)You can play the full game here:
